Each time the button is pressed it sends the command twice.

```

The device listens for MQTT commands or serial port commands to send the OFF command.  Sample Home Assistant yaml configuration:

Configuration (HA):

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
  	name: 'Temperature'
  	state_topic: '/18fe34d44eb8/sensor/temperature'
  	unit_of_measurent: 'ÂºC'
  - platform: mqtt
    name: 'Humidity'
    state_topic: '/18fe34d44eb8/sensor/humidity'
    unit_of_measurent: '%'
```
